## 🐛 Known Limitations & Future Work

### Current Limitations:
1. **Authentication**: Infrastructure ready but Supabase auth flow needs implementation
2. **Data Sync**: Some features use localStorage - gradual migration to Supabase in progress
3. **Real-time Sync**: Recordings don't sync across devices yet (needs Supabase Realtime)
4. **Team Features**: Leaderboard uses localStorage data (not cross-device yet)
5. **Storage Policies**: Need to run `supabase-storage-policies.sql` for photo uploads

### What's Already Working (No Limitations):
✅ **Voice transcription** - Whisper & AssemblyAI APIs fully operational
✅ **AI analysis** - Claude API delivering real coaching feedback & photo tagging
✅ **Photo Gallery** - Full upload, tagging, filtering, review workflow
✅ **Offline recording** - IndexedDB queue working perfectly
✅ **PWA installation** - Service workers & manifest configured
✅ **Supabase Storage** - Photos uploaded to cloud storage
✅ **Netlify Deployment** - Live in production

### Planned Improvements:
1. ✅ ~~Migrate from localStorage to Supabase database~~ (Photos done, recordings in progress)
2. Implement Supabase Auth with email/password + social logins
3. Upload audio recordings to Supabase Storage
4. Real-time subscriptions for team updates
5. Advanced analytics with charts & graphs
6. Export functionality for reports
