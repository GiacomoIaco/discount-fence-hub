 Cut Rotted Fence Bottoms & Install Kickboard (~40 Linear Feet) Project Description: Hi, I am looking for a quote to repair a section of my wooden privacy fence (approx. 40 linear feet) in San Antonio. The Issue: The bottom 2-3 inches of the fence pickets have rotted due to ground contact and standing water. The rest of the fence is in stable condition. The Scope of Work needed: Cut & Trim: Snap a line and cut the bottom of the pickets straight across to remove the rotted portions (approx. 2-3 inches up). Install Kickboard: Supply and install a 2x6 pressure-treated ""rot board"" (kickboard) at the bottom to seal the gap and protect the pickets from future ground contact. Materials: Use galvanized or exterior-grade screws (no nails) for the new board. Site Conditions: There is some standing water/mud along the fence line that needs to be worked around (see photos). Easy access to the yard. Optional: Please list the rot repair as the main quote. If you also offer drainage solutions (grading or french drain) to fix the standing water shown in the photos, please list that as a separate line item or ""optional add-on."" Thank you!",Yelp,Small,

Hello @ryan 

This is Sean Ford from the fencing project at 5229 Meadow Creek Dr that Jacob handled. 
Hope you had a nice holiday. 

We have had some continuous problems getting this project completed at our home.  I am a little frustrated  and spoke again  with Jacob about the installers still not correcting the issues and actually making it worse at my home when they came out a third time last week. I sent below status Friday to Jacob and he advised to escalate to you as he didn’t think you could get a different  crew member out as I don’t want the same crew member who keeps either not understanding the remaining issues on All gates or just doesn’t get it and has made it worse.  Please see below as I would like to get this worked out Monday with a crew never that actually  understands what both myself (3 times) and Jacob (3 times) had advised him to fix since they finished and we walked it .  

**************

Hey Jacob 

Here’s the issues that still haven’t been fixed and pics below 


Back bull fence.  He didn’t switch the  lock or  latch but instead , he changed all the black screws for silver ?????

Facing house 
Left side —- didn’t switch latch direction and left silver screw facing out - all others black 


Facing house Right side near garbage AC - didn’t change lock or latch sides and removed silver and left NO SCREW AT ALL -  plus looks like he bent the slide  fixture bolt  so that will need to be replaced 

I ask that you have someone else come out this next week to replace and fix these three as requested. This guy really doesn’t understand and I don’t want him back on property tbh as he has been out three times and not done the work but now I find bolt damage , more SILVER screws , a total Missing black screw  with hole left ,  and none of the latches swapped other direction   


@ryan Looping Jacob in as well if any questions. .  Please let me know who will be coming out to fix it and if you can get this corrected Monday.

Customer previously  Paid $199 for an operator service request and we changed the batteries out, everything was working properly. 



The new issue is that the gate opens but will not close. I advised the customer that are one of your parts and labor is for work and parts we originally performed.(batteries) So if we go out there and the issue is something other than the batteries there will be a $299 service charge (our new price) To do any additional repair work plus parts and labor if required After we do the assessment.



I spoke with Michael since he is the one that did the original service call and he may have time to swing by tomorrow. Please contact the customer listed above or keep me in the loop so I can communicate with him as well if he can go by at any point while he's in San Antonio today and tomorrow..

There is no neighbor on this side (yet) and so there is no other gate across from it, to help prevent it from moving outward. The gap that has opened up is so large now that the latch is useless - the bolt doesn't even make contact with the plate. After this picture was taken I had to use string to tie the gate shut since the wind was opening it. I don't know if there's an easy adjustment or whether a new gate is needed. I certainly don't want there to be a large gap at the edge as we have now. I would like you to inspect it and advise me on the best solution, please.

The ""picket"" picture: We recently had backyard work done. The contractors had to remove part of the fence in that area for access (for their equipment). One of the pickets has been angled and split since then, as you can see. (It's not flush with the other pickets.) Also, I suspect that an earlier contractor may have broken and replaced another of the pickets (the second red arrow) - and that picket may need to be stained to better match the others. You can't really see it in the picture, but its color is quite ""off"" from the others.

Yesterday afternoon I ran a few audits across Google & your website. I noticed your site was on page 2 & into page 3 of Google.
 
Looking over some of the clients at the top, you may notice the 3-pack next to the maps and the all-new Google Local Service Ads at the very top?
 
I’d like to send you a no-obligation proposal which will outline some of the bigger issues.
 
Can I send the proposal and a summary of the audit results tomorrow?

Hello, so I'm building a privacy fence to shield my shed from view of the road

35 feet total length 
Need a post every 6 feet 
Need three fence rails going between each post 
No pickets installed as I am going to use natural cedar branches as pickets, and I will install those myself
This is what it will look like from the street when I'm done. I have three of these on my property already and have been there for eight years. I just need another one.",,,

The left side fence is about 63’. It might be a bit more for the part that extends in front of the gate. This section needs replaced with metal posts. We don’t think the gate is ready to be replaced, and it is attached to the house, not a pole. 

ESTIMATE 2
This iron fence backs up to the preserve and I often find the need to go back there and clear brush/weeds. So we’d like an estimate on adding a gate to one of these segments somehow?

ESTIMATE 3
The right side fence probably has several more years… it’s in good condition and the posts on the neighbor’s side are metal. So if we did anything here, it would be replacing the wood fence part.

Perhaps break estimate into:
- Left side fence; 63’ - replace fence and install metal posts
- Right side fence; 71’ - replace wood only
- Metal Fence; install gate

The gate is sagging to the latch side of the gate causing the gate to get caught on the small rock wall when closing.
 

This could possibly be solved by replacing the hinges since there may be some damage due to the weight of the gate. It could also be possibly solved by modifying the post that the gate hinges are on to better account for the weight.

 

There were no repairs made today since it's not as simple as a latch adjustment and needs to be coordinated with a crew to come and fix. I attached pictures of the gate as well to better help inform everybody. I am including Patrick on this email as he was the original project manager on this project.

 

We will update you as soon as possible when we have a crew scheduled to get this repaired. For now, I closed the gate completely to give the homeowner a closed fence line at the street side of his home instead of it being slightly open.

Good morning. We have multiple issues with our fence. As I examined it closely I noticed lots of broken, cracked, marred or dented wood. Wood is warping and separating in certain areas. The nails were put in very sloppily. Exposed nails have begun to rust. Lastly, I originally asked for fence to overlap the small concrete barrier that surrounds the yard. In the last two pictures you can see part of the fence overlaps, but other parts do not.

Hi Matthew. I dropped by your office today and the staff suggested I contact you. I'm seeking quotes on a 41 foot chainlink fencing job at one of my rental properties. I have the job specs I can provide. To save $ I will want to keep an existing 44"" metal gate and I will also demo out the existing wooden post fencing.

Depending on cost, I may wan't light commercial grade fencing with schedule 20 pipes and 1 & 5/8"" top railing. The new fence will connect to an existing end post at the back of the yard. I will need two end posts (on each side of the gate, and three line posts. I will go with 4 or 5 ft. high fencing, depending on cost.  

I can meet you at the job site if you like. It's about 3 miles from your office. 

Thanks,

I’m not sure if you can do this, but I am inquiring. 

The first is a fence and gait that I want on my patio. Literally ON the patio. It’s a rectangular patio. Probably 6 feet by about 10 or 12 feet. I want fencing in between the posts along the 12 foot side, and a fence with a gate that leads out to the main backyard on one of the shorter sides. The third side will be open so that my dogs can go into their area. 

The second is the doggy area. It’s about 17’ x 5’ and I want the same type or similar fencing, for consistency, to block in that area to keep the dogs in. I have decorative border bricks in place partitioning the area because I will be putting down pea gravel for the dogs and need the bricks to keep the gravel in place. 

The third area is a decorative little fence that separates a play area for my grandkids. This area would have an opening about four or 5 feet wide. It doesn’t really need a gate, so it would essentially be two pieces of fence. Overall, that would probably be about 25 feet.

Is this something you could do? I have photos of the three areas if you need them.

You built my fence about 3 years ago and it is currently falling over in the back. I was told at the time the fence was built that you would come out and fix any problems at no cost. The problem is that one post was not settled correctly and it is now leaning over and taking the fence apart with it. The gate attached is also no longer shutting properly due to the shift. I need this resolved as soon as possible as my fence backs up to an open field and is a security issue. 

I have attached my receipt

Thank you,

1.	Jagged cut filler picket at bricks on right return
2.	Warped board (bottom) on right side fence near right return
3.	Warped board on right side fence
4.	High spot on right side (neighbor has filled in with rock and might be acceptable?)
5.	Most poles cut very uneven and caps do not sit on straight or level
6.	Several pickets on right side near back fence are warped/broken off pieces/large indentations (from strap?)
7.	Multiple rails look split on left side towards back fence
8.	Several 4-5? Pickets split on left side fence
9.	Several pickets cut thin on left return (for apparently no reason?)
10.	Customer complained about gap in gate opening at latch side (but this may be standard size gap? If gate able to be shifted 1/4 towards latch would make him happy!)
11.	Neighbor complained that there were several pickets facing her side that appeared to not be properly/fully stained (I was unable to verify due to gate being locked and homeowner not being home)
12.	Sprinkler line damaged at left return (customer is going to have his sprinkler guy repair and does not seek any compensation for the repair, just wanted to not it…)
Also, he would like 1 more picket added/replaced to the left rear corner because he can see the neighbors old picket through the gap at the corner. 

Pictures available of everything, it wouldn’t let me attach them to this email. 

Overall the guy loves the fence and would probably be willing to overlook a few of these things…

Would like the top capped and the whole fence stained in Sable Brown. There will need to be a work around where the fence along the driveway meets the low-hanging roof line. And I will need two gates -- one from the driveway to the backyard in the space where the small angular concrete pad is just inside that fence line, and the other to gate off and hide the trash bins with gate opening swinging to the right so it lets me easily pull the cans to and from the street curb. We will be pulling out the old chain link fence on the east side of the house--that is the property line for that new fence. On the rear side, all of that fencing belongs to the property behind us, so we will want our fence installed in front of it on our side.

Doing some planning and wanted to get a ballpark idea of how much the following type fence would cost.  The ballpark cost per linear foot will enable me to decide how many feet I’d like to install.  It would be between 200-400 feet.  

We are thinking about putting in a 4 foot pipe, with pipe top rail fence lined with 2”x4” high tensile, non climb woven wire with one piece of slick wire added at knee high to help with goats pushing on wire.  
We have about 200-400 feet.  2x4 woven would need to be stretched around corners.  All holes would need to be drilled as it is very rocky.  Pipe would also need to be painted.  There will be 4 corners and one end that need to be reinforced for stretching.  
Just trying to get a ballpark per linear foot for jobs between 200-400 feet.  
Also, please let me know how far apart the pipes normally are.  
Thank you!",Other (See Notes),"",""

Does that make sense? If somebody needs better explanation, they can call me.
 
Because the hinge post  is now too loose it makes the gate heavy to try to latch it when you close it, it’s obvious to see when you’re trying to close it yourself. It’s easy for me. I’m a big strong guy, but the tenant has trouble with it and he has two young kids that live there.

You had quoted my husband and I for a front yard fence back in February, but we were not ready to move forward at the time. 

Our address is 4509 S 2nd St, Austin, TX 78745 Unit 1.

We have been planning our fence and know exactly what we want now.

1. 6 ft Cedar horizontal board on board- both sides stained
2. Black steel posts
3. a Lattice structure going from 6-8 feet on top
4.  2 sliding doors

I will include a picture to show the style we like and also the lattice type structure. Please let me know if you guys do lattice structures or what you can do overall. We also have different dimensions for our fence so it will need to be measured again.

Thank you and look forward to hearing from you,

Please quarterback this offering to the appropriate manager for review.


This is from Al Spector, Founder of Biddaboom, and for homeowner associations… here is a FREE public relations offer that will make you a “Hero” to your members.  FREE to you and FREE to them with measurable savings on their inescapable home repair, maintenance and improvement needs.  

· BiddaBoom is a free web-based platform that takes bids from homeowners that they Already have “In hand” …and think it is possibly too high. These bids are for the hefty expenses of home repair, improvement and maintenance.

·  BiddaBoom takes their EXISTING, unaltered bid…de-identifies their contact information… and electronically shares that bid with highly rated contractors citywide to see if they can offer a better solution on that exact need without compromising on quality.

· These contractors will clearly see in detail what they are competing against including price…and want to offer a better outcome.  As all interest from contractors is funneled through the BiddaBoom platform, there is no concern on being spammed or receiving unwanted contact from those that cannot offer that better alternative.  The best part…there is never a cost to the homeowner as BiddaBoom is a totally free service.


There is absolutely, positively no risk or downside to those you introduce to this platform so you can refer in confidence.  Your homeowners don’t need more estimates, just a better price.  They will thank you for saving them hundreds or even thousands of dollars on their pressing needs.  A couple of keystrokes to your members is all that it will take.   Everyone wins.  BiddaBoom.com

I need to see if you could come out and give us a quote for another additional area of fencing along the back of our property.  Our insurance company sent out an independent adjustor to reinspect all damages from the September hail storm. They are possibly willing to include more linear feet in their scope of repairs. 
The adjustor also asked if you could write up the previous quote/invoice (work we already had completed) and include the full 80 linear feet of fencing instead of just the 40. He indicated that with the fence he could put in for the full amount on his new inspection but needs documentation from you showing this and the pricing.
I also had a few questions from the recent install you did on the new double gate and a couple of areas on the shared fence. I figured I could ask you about it when you come to measure for additional quote. Please let me know your availability. You can reach me at 512-775-3222. 
Thanks so much,

This is a duplex. At the front of the property there is a short pony fence (around 3ft in height and 140ft in length) that runs along the front yard and driveway that faces Garland Ave and Ledesma Rd. The existing wooden fence is rotted and falling so I'm looking to replace the entire fence and 1 gate with a more durable material such as that white vinyl/pvc fencing. Since the fence is only 3ft in height and not really designed for privacy as it is more for aesthetics, I'm looking for options for lowering the cost, so I'm not sure if vertical or horizontal is the way to go. If we go with horizontal rails, perhaps something like this would help on cost. Of course I'm open for other options.
