## 🚀 Next Step: Set Up Storage Policies

**You need to run ONE SQL script to enable photo uploads:**

### Step 1: Go to Supabase SQL Editor
1. Open [Supabase Dashboard](https://supabase.com/dashboard)
2. Select your project
3. Click **SQL Editor** in left sidebar
4. Click **New query**

### Step 2: Run Storage Policies Script
Copy and paste the contents of `supabase-storage-policies.sql` and click **Run**

This will create policies for:
- ✅ Users can upload photos to their own folder
- ✅ Users can view their own + published photos
- ✅ Managers/admins can view all photos
- ✅ Users can delete their own photos
- ✅ Admins can delete any photo

### Photos not appearing in gallery
**Check:**
1. Photo status is "published" (not "pending")
2. Your role has permission to view
3. Browser console for errors

### AI tagging not working
**Check:**
1. `VITE_ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` is set in `.env`
2. Netlify function deployed
3. Check Netlify function logs

### Thumbnails not loading
**Check:**
1. `photos/{userId}/thumb/` folder exists
2. Storage policies allow SELECT
3. getPublicUrl returned valid URL
