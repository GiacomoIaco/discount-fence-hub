## 🐛 Recent Fixes

### Stats Column Alignment (October 12, 2025)
**Problem**: Stats columns (open rate, acknowledgment, survey response, comments) were not aligned vertically across different announcement cards.

**Root Cause**: Title section had variable width (`min-w-[200px] max-w-[300px]`), causing stats to start at different horizontal positions.

**Solution**: Align stats from right side of card instead of left
- Title section: `flex-1 min-w-0` (flexible, takes available space)
- Stats section: `flex-shrink-0` (fixed width, anchored right)
- Individual stat columns: Fixed widths (90px, 90px, 90px, 80px)

**Result**: All stat columns now perfectly aligned across all cards regardless of title length.

---

### Survey Response Tracking (October 12, 2025)
**Problem**: Survey responses weren't appearing in admin view stats.

**Root Cause**:
1. Survey.js responses stored in `text_response` as JSON
2. Admin view only checked `selected_options` array (legacy format)
3. `message_engagement` table not updated on survey submission

**Solution**:
1. Updated survey results loading to fetch both `text_response` and `selected_options`
2. Added JSON parsing for Survey.js format: `JSON.parse(response.text_response)`
3. Maintained backward compatibility with legacy format
4. Added `message_engagement` update on survey submission:
   ```typescript
   await supabase
     .from('message_engagement')
     .upsert({
       message_id: messageId,
       user_id: user.id,
       responded_at: new Date().toISOString()
     }, { onConflict: 'message_id,user_id' });
   ```

**Result**: Survey responses now tracked correctly in both formats, stats update properly.

## 🚀 Future Enhancements

### High Priority

#### 1. **Client Survey System** 🔨 NOT STARTED
**Purpose**: Survey external clients (not internal team members)

**Key Differences from Team Announcements**:
- **Public Access**: No login required
- **Anonymous Responses**: Don't track who responded (optional)
- **Custom URLs**: Each survey gets unique link (e.g., `/survey/abc123`)
- **External Database**: Separate table from internal announcements
- **Email Distribution**: Send survey links via email
- **Response Limits**: Prevent duplicate submissions (IP/cookie based)

**Planned Features**:
- Multi-page surveys (unlike announcements which are single-page)
- Question logic/branching
- Response quotas (limit total responses)
- Survey expiration dates
- Export responses to CSV
- Response analytics dashboard
- Custom branding/themes

**Components Needed**:
- `ClientSurveyBuilder.tsx` - Create client surveys (can use Survey.js)
- `ClientSurveyView.tsx` - Public survey taking interface
- `ClientSurveyDashboard.tsx` - Admin view of all client surveys
- `ClientSurveyResults.tsx` - View and analyze responses

**Database Tables Needed**:
```sql
CREATE TABLE client_surveys (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
  title TEXT NOT NULL,
  description TEXT,
  survey_json JSONB NOT NULL,  -- Survey.js definition
  created_by UUID REFERENCES user_profiles(id),
  created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW(),
  expires_at TIMESTAMP,
  max_responses INTEGER,
  allow_multiple_responses BOOLEAN DEFAULT false,
  anonymous BOOLEAN DEFAULT true,
  status TEXT DEFAULT 'active',  -- active, paused, closed
  public_url_slug TEXT UNIQUE NOT NULL
);

CREATE TABLE client_survey_responses (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
  survey_id UUID REFERENCES client_surveys(id),
  response_data JSONB NOT NULL,  -- Survey.js response
  submitted_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW(),
  ip_address TEXT,
  user_agent TEXT,
  metadata JSONB  -- Optional: referrer, utm params, etc.
);
```

**Estimated Effort**: 12-16 hours
- Survey builder UI: 3-4 hours
- Public survey view: 2-3 hours
- Response submission & storage: 2-3 hours
- Admin dashboard: 3-4 hours
- Results analytics: 2-3 hours

**Priority**: Medium-High (good for gathering customer feedback)

#### 2. **Email Notifications for Announcements** 🔨 NOT STARTED
**Purpose**: Send email when new announcement is posted

**Features:**
- Email sent to all recipients when announcement published
- Digest option (daily/weekly summary of unread)
- Reminder emails for unanswered surveys
- User preferences for notification types

**Implementation:**
- Netlify function for email sending
- Email templates
- Supabase trigger on message insert
- User notification preferences table

---

#### 3. **Real-time Updates** 🔨 NOT STARTED
**Purpose**: Auto-update when new announcements posted

**Features:**
- Supabase Realtime subscriptions
- Live unread count updates
- Toast notifications for new messages
- Optimistic UI updates

**Implementation:**
```typescript
useEffect(() => {
  const subscription = supabase
    .channel('company_messages')
    .on('postgres_changes', {
      event: 'INSERT',
      schema: 'public',
      table: 'company_messages'
    }, (payload) => {
      // Add new message to state
      // Update unread count
      // Show toast notification
    })
    .subscribe();
  return () => subscription.unsubscribe();
}, []);
```

- Full-text search across titles and content
- Filter by type, date, sender
- Search in survey questions/responses

#### 5. **Swipe Gestures (Mobile)** 🔨 NOT STARTED
- Swipe to archive messages
- Swipe to pin important announcements

#### 6. **CSV Export for Survey Results** 🔨 NOT STARTED
- Export button exists, needs implementation
- Include all questions and responses

## 📊 System Architecture

### Data Flow

**Creating Announcement:**
1. Admin opens MessageComposer
2. Selects message type, adds content
3. Optional: Adds survey via SimpleSurveyBuilder
4. Saves as draft OR publishes
5. On publish: `company_messages` table updated with `status='active'`

**Employee Views Announcement:**
1. User opens Chat > Company Announcements
2. AnnouncementsView loads messages for user's role
3. User clicks announcement card
4. `markAsRead()` called:
   - Updates `message_receipts` table
   - Upserts `message_engagement` with `opened_at` timestamp
5. User sees content + survey (if present)

**Employee Responds to Survey:**
1. User fills out survey form
2. `handleSurveyResponse()` called
3. Response saved to `message_responses`:
   - `text_response`: Survey.js JSON (`{ question1: answer1, question2: answer2 }`)
   - `response_type`: 'survey_answer'
4. `message_engagement` updated with `responded_at` timestamp
5. UI shows "Thank you" message

**Admin Views Stats:**
1. Admin opens Announcements Management
2. Loads all messages created by admin
3. For each message, queries `message_engagement` table:
   - Count records with `opened_at` → Open rate
   - Count records with `acknowledged_at` → Acknowledgment rate
   - Count records with `responded_at` → Survey response rate
4. Stats displayed in aligned columns
5. Clicking "Results" button shows aggregated survey data

## 🎯 Key Technical Decisions

### Why Survey.js?
- **Rich question types**: Multiple choice, rating, text, etc.
- **JSON-based**: Easy storage in JSONB column
- **Customizable**: Can disable features (like multi-page)
- **Well-documented**: Good React integration

### Why Right-Aligned Stats?
- **Flexible titles**: Don't need to truncate or fix title width
- **Perfect alignment**: Stats always start at same horizontal position
- **Responsive**: Works on all screen sizes
- **Maintainable**: Easy to add/remove stat columns

### Why Separate message_engagement Table?
- **Performance**: Index on (message_id, user_id) for fast lookups
- **Atomic updates**: Can update opened/acknowledged/responded independently
- **Analytics**: Easy to query engagement patterns
- **Scalability**: Doesn't bloat company_messages table

---

## 🔐 Security & Permissions

### Row-Level Security (RLS)
All tables use Supabase RLS:
- **company_messages**: Users see messages for their role
- **message_engagement**: Users can only update their own records
- **message_responses**: Users can only create responses for themselves
- **message_receipts**: Users can only update their own receipts

### Admin-Only Actions
- Create/edit announcements
- View all engagement stats
- Delete messages
- View survey results with user names

### User Actions
- View announcements for their role
- Mark as read
- Acknowledge policies
- Respond to surveys
- Add comments
