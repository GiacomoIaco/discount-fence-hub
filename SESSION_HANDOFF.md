### Key Decisions Made

‚úÖ **Approach:** Gradual, safe refactoring with extensive testing
‚úÖ **Branching:** Feature branches ‚Üí develop ‚Üí main (protected)
‚úÖ **Testing:** Unit + Integration + E2E before each deploy
‚úÖ **Rollout:** Feature flags for gradual rollout (10% ‚Üí 25% ‚Üí 50% ‚Üí 100%)
‚úÖ **Priority:** Phase 1 first (Critical fixes)

## Critical Issues Identified

### üî¥ CRITICAL (Fix Immediately)

1. **AI Sales Coach Data in localStorage**
   - Location: `src/lib/recordings.ts:359-733`
   - Risk: Data loss when cache cleared
   - Solution: Full Supabase migration (schema + migration script provided)
   - Timeline: 2-3 days

2. **Database Migration Conflicts**
   - Files: 003, 005, 006 have duplicate numbers
   - Risk: Deployment failures
   - Solution: Renumber + tracking system
   - Timeline: 3 hours

3. **67KB Code Duplication**
   - Files: 3x TeamCommunication components
   - Impact: Bundle size + maintenance
   - Solution: Consolidate with shared hooks
   - Timeline: 4 days

### üü† HIGH (Next Priority)

4. **N+1 Query Problems**
   - Location: `src/lib/requests.ts:getUnreadCounts()`
   - Impact: 100x slower with many requests
   - Solution: Batch queries + database functions
   - Timeline: 2 days

5. **No Error Boundaries**
   - Impact: Single error crashes entire app
   - Solution: Add global error boundary
   - Timeline: 4 hours

6. **No Input Validation**
   - Risk: Bad data + security issues
   - Solution: Add Zod validation
   - Timeline: 1 day

## Common Questions & Answers

**Q: Should I start with Phase 1?**
A: Yes! It's the safest starting point and prevents data loss.

**Q: Can I skip testing?**
A: No - testing is what makes refactoring safe. It's your safety net.

**Q: What if something breaks?**
A: Follow rollback procedures in RISK_MITIGATION_STRATEGY.md. You'll have:
- Feature flags (instant rollback)
- Git history (revert commits)
- Database backups (restore data)

**Q: How long will this take?**
A: 10 weeks to enterprise-ready with safety measures. Worth it!

**Q: Can I do multiple phases in parallel?**
A: Not recommended. Finish Phase 1 first to build confidence and establish patterns.

**Q: What if I get stuck?**
A: Reference the detailed documents. Each has:
- Step-by-step instructions
- Code examples
- Troubleshooting tips

**Q: Should I involve other developers?**
A: Eventually yes, but establish patterns yourself first in Phase 1.
