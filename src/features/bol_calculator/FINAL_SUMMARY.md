## 🎯 Your Brilliant Insight

> **"What if we share the UI and logic, but avoid transferring code that needs rewriting?"**

This is **exactly right**! Here's what that means:

### ✅ Share (Documentation):
- Business logic **specifications** (formulas)
- UI **patterns** (layout, design)
- Database **structure** (schema)
- Test **scenarios** (validation)

### ✅ Reference (Legacy Code):
- Keep in `legacy/` folder
- Use for visual verification
- Check when uncertain
- Don't copy directly

### ✅ Build Fresh (Claude Code):
- Modern TypeScript
- Your app's patterns
- Clean architecture
- Proven UI/UX

---

## 🚀 Quick Start Guide

### Step 1: Copy to Your Project (5 minutes)
```bash
# In your Claude Code project root:

# Create folder structure
mkdir -p src/modules/bom-calculator/_docs
mkdir -p src/modules/bom-calculator/legacy

# Copy documentation (knowledge)
cd /path/to/downloaded/files
cp 00-README.md src/modules/bom-calculator/_docs/
cp 01-PROJECT_CONTEXT.md src/modules/bom-calculator/_docs/
cp 02-BUSINESS_LOGIC.md src/modules/bom-calculator/_docs/
cp 03-DATABASE_SCHEMA.sql src/modules/bom-calculator/_docs/
cp 05-MIGRATION_CHECKLIST.md src/modules/bom-calculator/_docs/
cp 06-UI_SPECIFICATION.md src/modules/bom-calculator/_docs/
cp 07-UPDATED_APPROACH.md src/modules/bom-calculator/_docs/

# Copy legacy code (reference)
cp -r "01. Complete BOM App/"* src/modules/bom-calculator/legacy/
```

### Step 2: Start Claude Code (2 minutes)
```bash
# Open project in Claude Code
claude-code /path/to/your-project

# Or VS Code with Claude extension
code /path/to/your-project
```

### Step 3: Initial Conversation (Copy/Paste This)
```
I need to build a BOM/BOL Calculator module for our fencing company.

CONTEXT:
• All requirements documented in src/modules/bom-calculator/_docs/
• Current production UI is excellent - want to preserve it
• Legacy code in legacy/ folder is REFERENCE ONLY (don't copy)
• Build fresh TypeScript using OUR app's patterns

KEY DOCUMENTS:
1. Start: 00-README.md (overview)
2. Formulas: 02-BUSINESS_LOGIC.md (CRITICAL - every calculation)
3. UI Patterns: 06-UI_SPECIFICATION.md (exact UI specs)
4. Guidance: 07-UPDATED_APPROACH.md (how to approach this)

GOALS:
✓ Same UI/UX as legacy (users love it)
✓ Modern clean code (TypeScript, your patterns)
✓ Integrated seamlessly (use our components/patterns)

Please:
1. Read all docs in _docs/ folder
2. Explore our existing app structure
3. Review legacy/ folder for UI reference
4. Ask clarifying questions
5. Then we'll build this step-by-step using 05-MIGRATION_CHECKLIST.md

Ready? Start by reading the docs and let me know when you understand
the requirements.
```

## 📞 Using This Package

### For You:
1. ✅ Copy files to project
2. ✅ Start Claude Code conversation
3. ✅ Point to specific docs when needed
4. ✅ Verify output matches legacy
5. ✅ Provide feedback

5. ✅ Reference legacy for UI
6. ✅ Test against checklist

### Common Scenarios:

**"How do I calculate posts?"**
→ Reference 02-BUSINESS_LOGIC.md, section "Wood Vertical Calculations → POSTS"

**"What should the Calculator UI look like?"**
→ Reference 06-UI_SPECIFICATION.md, section "Main Calculator View"
→ Check legacy/components/calculator.js for exact implementation

**"How do I integrate with your app?"**
→ Reference 07-UPDATED_APPROACH.md, section "The Workflow"
→ Show Claude Code similar modules in your app

**"What's the database structure?"**
→ Run 03-DATABASE_SCHEMA.sql
→ Reference comments in schema for details

---

## 🎯 Timeline Expectations

### Realistic Timeline (with Claude Code):
- **Week 1:** Database + Types
- **Week 2:** Business Logic + Services
- **Week 3:** UI Components
- **Week 4:** Integration + Testing
- **Week 5:** Migration + Deployment

**Total: 4-5 weeks to production**

### What Could Slow Down:
- Complex integration with your app's patterns
- Data migration issues from Airtable
- User acceptance testing feedback
- Performance optimization needs

### What Could Speed Up:
- Your app already uses Supabase
- Your component library is comprehensive
- Your team is experienced with TypeScript
- Minimal data to migrate

---

## 🔥 Critical Success Factors

### 1. **Post Type Field (CRITICAL!)**
The most important business rule:
```typescript
// MUST check post_type for labor codes
if (sku.post_type === 'STEEL') {
  laborCodes.push('M03'); // Metal codes
} else {
  laborCodes.push('W03'); // Wood codes
}
```

### 2. **Concrete is Project-Level**
Don't calculate per line item:
```typescript
// ✅ CORRECT
totalPosts = sum(allLineItems.posts);
project.concrete = calculateConcrete(totalPosts);

// ❌ WRONG
lineItem.concrete = calculateConcrete(lineItem.posts);
```

### 3. **Fence-Specific Product Tables**
Use explicit tables, not generic:
```sql
-- ✅ GOOD
wood_vertical_products (
  post_material_id,
  picket_material_id,
  rail_material_id
)

-- ❌ BAD
products (
  fence_type,
  component_1,
  component_2
)
```
