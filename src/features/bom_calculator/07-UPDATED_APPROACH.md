- ✅ When in doubt, check here
- ❌ Don't copy directly
- 👉 Reference for "how does this look/work?"

---

## 🚀 The Workflow

### Step 1: Claude Code Reads Documentation
```
Claude Code:
1. Read 00-README.md (overview)
2. Read 02-BUSINESS_LOGIC.md (formulas)
3. Read 06-UI_SPECIFICATION.md (UI patterns)
4. Explore your app's codebase (your patterns)
5. Look at legacy/ folder (UI reference)

Result: Understands WHAT to build and HOW it should look
```

### Step 2: Claude Code Builds Using Your Patterns
```typescript
// Claude Code will:
1. Create TypeScript types (matching YOUR style)
2. Implement FenceCalculator (using formulas from docs)
3. Build UI components (matching 06-UI_SPECIFICATION.md)
4. Use YOUR component library (Button, Input, Select)
5. Follow YOUR file structure
6. Style with YOUR Tailwind config

Result: Code that feels native to your app, UI that looks like legacy
```

### Step 3: Visual Verification
```
You:
1. Compare new UI with legacy UI side-by-side
2. Check calculations match (use test cases)
3. Verify user experience feels the same
4. Provide feedback: "Make the Calculate button larger like legacy"

Claude Code:
1. Adjusts based on feedback
2. References legacy/ folder for exact details
3. Iterates until it matches

Result: Same great UX, modern clean code
```

## 💡 Why This Approach Wins

### ✅ Advantages:

**1. Best of Both Worlds**
- Modern, maintainable code (TypeScript, clean architecture)
- Proven, user-tested UX (from production system)

**2. Efficient Development**
- No time wasted translating old patterns
- No time wasted redesigning working UI
- Focus on getting it right

**3. Lower Risk**
- UI changes confuse users → Keep UI the same
- Old code has tech debt → Rewrite from specs
- Business logic well-documented → No guesswork

**4. Easier Testing**
- Visual comparison with legacy system
- Calculation verification against known results
- User acceptance testing (looks familiar!)

**5. Future Maintainability**
- Clean TypeScript (easy to modify)
- Well-documented formulas (in docs)
- Modern architecture (scalable)

## 🎯 Specific Guidance for Claude Code

### First Conversation:
```
I need to build a BOM/BOL Calculator module for our fencing company.

IMPORTANT CONTEXT:
1. All business logic is documented in _docs/ folder
2. The current production UI is excellent - I want to preserve it
3. Documentation in 06-UI_SPECIFICATION.md shows exact UI patterns
4. Legacy code in legacy/ folder is for REFERENCE only (don't copy)
5. Build fresh TypeScript/React using OUR app's patterns

GOALS:
- Same UI/UX as legacy system (reference legacy/ and 06-UI_SPECIFICATION.md)
- Clean, modern code architecture (use our patterns)
- All formulas from 02-BUSINESS_LOGIC.md

Read the docs, explore our codebase, then let's build this right.
```

### When Claude Code Asks About UI:
```
"Reference 06-UI_SPECIFICATION.md for the design pattern, 
and check legacy/components/calculator.js for exact implementation.
Build the same UI using our component library."
```

### When Claude Code Asks About Calculations:
```
"The exact formula is in 02-BUSINESS_LOGIC.md, section X.
Don't reference legacy code - implement from the formula spec."
```

### When Claude Code Asks About Integration:
```
"Look at [similar module] in our app for the pattern.
Use the same folder structure and conventions."
```

## 🎨 UI Preservation Strategy

### What to Keep Exactly:
- ✅ Layout structure (header, main sections, grids)
- ✅ Component hierarchy (collapsible line items, etc.)
- ✅ Color scheme (primary blue, accent green, df red)
- ✅ Button styles and placement
- ✅ Table layouts (BOM/BOL display)
- ✅ Form patterns (NumericInput auto-select, etc.)
- ✅ Responsive behavior (mobile → desktop)

### What to Improve:
- ✅ Code architecture (TypeScript, better separation)
- ✅ State management (modern hooks)
- ✅ Error handling (more robust)
- ✅ Accessibility (add ARIA labels)
- ✅ Testing (unit + integration tests)

### Visual Verification Checklist:
```
Side-by-side comparison:
- [ ] Header looks identical
- [ ] Navigation buttons in same positions
- [ ] Project Details form layout matches
- [ ] Line items expand/collapse same way
- [ ] Calculate button same size/position
- [ ] BOM table layout identical
- [ ] BOL table layout identical
- [ ] SKU Builder tabs and layout match
- [ ] Colors exactly the same
- [ ] Spacing and padding consistent
```

## ⚡ Example: Building Calculator Component

### Claude Code's Process:

**1. Read Specs:**
- 06-UI_SPECIFICATION.md → "Calculator has 4 main sections: Project Details, Line Items, Calculate Button, Results"

**2. Check Your App:**
- Explore existing modules → "They use FormCard and DataTable components"

**3. Reference Legacy:**
- Look at legacy/calculator.js → "NumericInput auto-selects on focus - nice UX!"

**4. Build:**
```typescript
// New Calculator.tsx (Claude Code creates)
import { FormCard, DataTable, Button } from '@/shared/components/ui';
import { useCalculator } from '../hooks/useCalculator';

export function Calculator() {
  const { project, lineItems, calculate, results } = useCalculator();
  
  return (
    <div className="max-w-7xl mx-auto px-4 py-8">
      {/* Project Details - matches legacy layout */}
      <FormCard className="mb-6">
        <h2>Project Details</h2>
        {/* Same fields as legacy, using YOUR form components */}
      </FormCard>
      
      {/* Line Items - matches legacy expandable cards */}
      {lineItems.map(item => (
        <LineItemCard key={item.id} item={item} />
      ))}
      
      {/* Calculate Button - same size and position as legacy */}
      <div className="text-center mb-6">
        <Button
          size="lg"
          variant="primary"
          onClick={calculate}
        >
          Calculate BOM/BOL
        </Button>
      </div>
      
      {/* Results - same table layout as legacy */}
      {results && <ResultsTables results={results} />}
    </div>
  );
}
```

**5. Verify:**
- Compare visually with legacy/calculator.js
- Test calculations match specs
- User tests: "Feels the same!"

## 🚀 Ready to Start?

Copy to your project:
```bash
# Documentation (pure knowledge)
cp *.md src/modules/bom-calculator/_docs/
cp 03-DATABASE_SCHEMA.sql src/modules/bom-calculator/_docs/

# Legacy code (UI reference)
cp -r "01. Complete BOM App/"* src/modules/bom-calculator/legacy/
```

Tell Claude Code:
```
Read _docs/ for requirements and UI specs.
Reference legacy/ for visual details.
Build fresh using our app's patterns.
Let's create a better version of what works!
```

**This approach gives Claude Code everything it needs while avoiding the pitfalls of code translation. Perfect!** 🎉
